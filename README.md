# Revive Bookings — WhatsApp Booking Agent (Phase 1)

An AI agent on WhatsApp that books clients into classes at **Revive** (studio) via Wix Bookings, taking payment first via **Wave** (Senegal mobile money). Conversation is handled by Claude; all state lives in Postgres.

> **Payment-first invariant:** a booking is NEVER created in Wix until a Wave payment webhook is verified. The Wix booking is created in exactly one place: the Wave webhook handler ([src/webhooks/wave.ts](src/webhooks/wave.ts)).

## Architecture

```

                   Claude API      Wix Bookings     Postgres
                  (conversation)  (availability,   (state, logs)
                                   create booking)
```

Single deployable Fastify service. No frontend — everything happens in WhatsApp, plus two tiny "return to WhatsApp" pages for Wave redirects.

## Setup

Requirements: **Node 20+**, **Postgres** (any managed instance).

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then fill it in (see below)
npm run migrate           # creates tables (idempotent; also runs at boot)
npm run dev               # hot reload; tries the next port when PORT is occupied
```

Pour ouvrir l’admin local avec les données réelles de production :

```bash
npm run dev:prod-db:check  # vérifie la connexion Railway sans modifier les données
npm run dev:prod-db        # hot reload + base de production
```

Cette commande récupère uniquement `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` depuis le service
Postgres Railway. Elle conserve les autres variables du `.env` local et ne
lance aucun worker périodique (expiration, réconciliation ou notification),
afin de ne pas doubler les tâches du serveur de production. Les formulaires et
boutons de l’admin restent toutefois réels : toute action effectuée en local
modifie la base de production.

### Environment variables

| Variable | What / where to get it |
|---|---|
| `WA_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | Meta app → WhatsApp → API Setup (test number in Phase 1) |
| `WA_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Permanent system-user token (Meta Business settings) |
| `WA_APP_SECRET` | Meta app dashboard → App settings → Basic → App secret |
| `WA_VERIFY_TOKEN` | Any string; must match what you type in the Meta webhook config |
| `WA_APP_ID` | Optional — Meta app ID (not the phone-number id), only needed to change the WhatsApp Business profile photo from `/admin/profile` (resumable upload API is app-scoped) |
| `WA_RENEWAL_TEMPLATE` / `WA_RENEWAL_TEMPLATE_LANG` | Optional — approved Meta template for the pre-expiry renewal nudge (3 vars: name, plan, end date). Empty = renewal push disabled (the in-conversation renewal offer still works). Lang defaults to `fr` |
| `RENEWAL_NUDGE_DAYS` | Optional — days before a plan's end date to send the renewal nudge (default 3) |
| `WIX_API_KEY` / `WIX_SITE_ID` | Wix account → API keys ([docs](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings)) |
| `WAVE_API_KEY` | Wave business portal — `wave_sn_prod_...` ([docs](https://docs.wave.com/checkout)) |
| `WAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `wave_sn_WHS_...` — shown **once** when you register the webhook endpoint in the Wave portal (Developer → Webhooks). Not the `wave_sn_AKS_` request-signing secret. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | console.anthropic.com |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | defaults to `claude-sonnet-5` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string |
| `BASE_URL` | Public HTTPS URL of this service (tunnel URL in local dev) |
| `RECEPTION_PHONE` | Human handoff destination; used to build contextual `wa.me` links with a prefilled message |
| `PAYMENT_LINK_TTL_MINUTES` | Wave link validity (default 20) |
| `STUDIO_ADDRESS` | Shown in booking confirmations |

The service refuses to boot with missing vars and lists them all at once.

### Local development with webhooks

Webhooks need a public HTTPS URL. Use a tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 3000            # or: cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Set `BASE_URL` to the tunnel URL, then:

1. **Meta**: App dashboard → WhatsApp → Configuration → Webhook:
   - Callback URL: `{BASE_URL}/webhooks/whatsapp`
   - Verify token: your `WA_VERIFY_TOKEN`
   - Subscribe to the `messages` field.
2. **Wave**: register `{BASE_URL}/webhooks/wave` in the Wave portal and copy the webhook secret into `WAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Phase 1 runs on Meta's **free test number** (up to 5 pre-verified recipients — add them in API Setup). Moving to a production number later only changes `WA_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` and `WA_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## Simulating Wave payments

Until Wave API access is granted (or to test without paying), simulate the payment webhook:

```bash
# 1. Chat with the bot on WhatsApp until it sends you a payment link.
# 2. Grab the pending booking id (= Wave client_reference):
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "select id, service_name, status from pending_bookings order by created_at desc limit 3;"

# 3. Fire a signed checkout.session.completed event:
npm run simulate:wave -- <pending_booking_id>

# Useful variants:
npm run simulate:wave -- <id> --bad-signature        # must be rejected with 401, no state change
npm run simulate:wave -- <id> --event-id EV_dup      # run twice → second is a no-op (idempotency)
npm run simulate:wave -- <id> --url https://<staging>/webhooks/wave
```

For real-money testing, Wave supports small amounts (e.g. 100 XOF) — configure a cheap test class in Wix.

## Booking flow / state machine

```
DRAFT ──payment link created──► AWAITING_PAYMENT
AWAITING_PAYMENT ──TTL passed──────────────► EXPIRED
AWAITING_PAYMENT ──valid Wave webhook──────► PAID
EXPIRED ──late Wave webhook────────────────► PAID   (money taken; honored)
PAID ──slot still free, Wix booking OK─────► BOOKED
PAID ──slot gone or Wix error──────────────► REFUND_NEEDED
```

- Transitions are single atomic conditional `UPDATE`s ([src/domain/stateMachine.ts](src/domain/stateMachine.ts)) — duplicate webhooks and two-clients-racing-for-the-last-spot resolve safely (first webhook wins; loser → `REFUND_NEEDED`).
- `REFUND_NEEDED` has **no automated refund** in Phase 1: the client is told they'll be refunded within 24h, and the case shows up in `npm run summary` for manual processing in the Wave portal.
- One active payment link per client — creating a new one expires the previous.
- `event_id`s coming from the model are validated against a server-side cache of slots actually shown to that client (prompt-injection stance, SPEC §9). Prices always come from the Wix catalog, never from model output.

## Bar orders

Awa can bundle a bar order (smoothies, matcha, food) into a class booking: one Wave link covers class + bar, the client confirmation lists the items, and reception is notified (email + WhatsApp) to prepare the order — by default ready after the class.

- **Menu source of truth: the `cafe_menu_items` table**, edited in the admin (**Bar → Menu bar**, `/admin/menu`) — searchable catalogue, dedicated item forms, recipe completion filters, and add/edit/remove with no redeploy. Each item can carry an internal recipe split into ingredients/quantities and preparation steps; both fields are optional and **never enter Awa's prompt or any client-facing output**. On the FIRST boot (empty table) the public catalogue fields are seeded from [cafe-menu.md](cafe-menu.md); after that the file is ignored. Ids are auto-generated (UPPER_SNAKE slug of the name) and never reused — "removing" an item archives it (`enabled=false`) together with its recipe. Prices are always resolved server-side from the table (the model only passes ids — same anti-injection stance as slots). The live menu is an in-memory snapshot refreshed on every commercial edit, so Awa's prompt and the delivery form update instantly; the `<cafe_menu>` prompt block is rebuilt only on a menu edit, keeping the Anthropic prompt-cache prefix stable otherwise.
- v1 limitations: no bundling with membership bookings (no payment link) and no bar-only orders — both are counter-only, Awa says so.

## Operations

```bash
npm run summary     # daily plain-text summary: bookings, REFUNDS NEEDED, handoffs, expired links
npm test            # unit tests: signature verifiers, state machine, bar menu, messages
npm run test:integration   # payment-path integration tests — needs Docker running
                           # (throwaway Postgres container; Wix/Wave/Meta mocked, no real API touched)
npm run build && npm start   # production
```

### Admin dashboard (`/admin`)

Server-rendered, zero-runtime-dependency dashboard (`src/admin/`) protected by
a signed 30-day login session (HTTP Basic remains available for scripts). Set
`ADMIN_USERS="reception:pass1,equipe:pass2"` for restricted team accounts; unset
→ built-in fallback `revive` / `revive@5000`. Configure the separate owner account
with `OWNER_ADMIN_USER` and `OWNER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: one owner login grants the whole
dashboard, including coach payments, without a second password. The legacy
`OWNER_PAYMENTS_PASSWORD` remains a temporary password fallback during migration.
The responsive Revive design system
uses a task-oriented sidebar, global client search (`Ctrl/Cmd+K`), an off-canvas
mobile menu, accessible focus states and confirmation dialogs. `/admin` opens
with day/7-day/30-day studio activity and the operational queue. **Clients →
Suivi clients** combines handoffs and conversations to resume, requires a
closure outcome, and keeps a durable history. Every conversation URL is now a
client workspace joining messages, reservations, plans, orders, documents and
open follow-ups. Optional guarded human replies use an explicit 12-hour takeover
(`ADMIN_HUMAN_REPLY_ENABLED=true` after Meta verification), which hard-pauses Awa
for that client and stores idempotent delivery results. The full admin also covers bookings, staff
planning, coach payments, documents, gifts, bar deliveries/menu, notifications
and WhatsApp profile settings; `/admin/rapport` adds period comparisons and the
owner-only action journal is at `/admin/journal`. Team accounts cannot access coach-payment pages,
PDFs or mutations; this is enforced server-side. Financial buttons only RECORD manual actions —
no money ever moves from the dashboard; refunds are done by a human in the Wave
portal (`npm run refund:done` remains as CLI fallback).

**Profile page (`/admin/profile`)**: edit the WhatsApp Business profile
(description, address, photo) via the Cloud API's `whatsapp_business_profile`
endpoint. Meta has **no "hours" field** on that endpoint — hours are entered
in their own textarea and folded into the description text as a trailing
block (`composeBusinessDescription` in [src/lib/whatsapp.ts](src/lib/whatsapp.ts)),
truncated to stay under Meta's 512-char description limit. The last-saved
values are kept in the `whatsapp_profile` table so the form round-trips even
though hours have nowhere to live on Meta's side. Photo editing needs an
additional `WA_APP_ID` env var (Meta's resumable upload API is app-scoped,
not phone-number-scoped) — without it the photo field is hidden and
description/address/hours still work.

Deploy target: Railway / Render / Fly.io — anything that runs Node and exposes HTTPS. Set all env vars, point `DATABASE_URL` at managed Postgres; migrations run automatically at boot. The service is stateless apart from Postgres, so restarts mid-flow lose nothing (acceptance #8) — the in-memory rate limiter and Wix catalog cache rebuild themselves.

## Notes & known unknowns

- **Wix API shapes**: paths follow the current Wix REST docs (Services V2, Availability Calendar V1, Bookings V2). Per the spec, verify request/response shapes against [the Wix docs](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings) once real credentials are available — [src/lib/wix.ts](src/lib/wix.ts) is the only file to adjust.
- **Wave webhook signature**: `HMAC-SHA256(secret, timestamp + body)` with the `Wave-Signature: t=...,v1=...` header — confirmed against [Wave's webhook docs](https://docs.wave.com/webhook). Make sure the secret in `WAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is the **webhook** secret (`wave_sn_WHS_...`, shown once at endpoint registration), not the API request-signing secret (`wave_sn_AKS_...`).
- **Model**: the spec says `claude-sonnet-latest`; the current alias is `claude-sonnet-5` (set via `CLAUDE_MODEL`).
- The `specs` file in this repo contains a live WhatsApp access token in its env block — it is gitignored until that block is scrubbed. **Consider that token exposed and rotate it in the Meta dashboard.**

## Acceptance checklist (SPEC §10)

1. Happy path FR: greet → list classes → pick slot → pay (simulated webhook) → Wix booking exists → WhatsApp confirmation.
2. Same in EN and Wolof (language mirrored; confirmation templates exist in all three).
3. Expired link → no booking; client can request a fresh link (TTL sweep + lazy expiry).
4. Forged Wave webhook → 401, no state change (`--bad-signature`).
5. Duplicate Wave webhook → exactly one Wix booking (`processed_webhooks` + atomic PAID transition).
6. Slot-taken race → `REFUND_NEEDED` recorded, client notified, no Wix booking.
7. Complaint / formal invoice / human request → handoff row + contextual `wa.me` link; tapping it opens the prefilled reception message and the client taps Send.
8. Restart mid-flow → no lost state (everything in Postgres).
9. Unit tests: both signature verifiers, state machine transitions (`npm test`).
